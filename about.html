                    of time and
                    continue to meet the requirements expected of it in the current socio–economic scenario of the
                    country. The NCC aims at developing character, comradeship, discipline, a secular outlook, the
                    spirit of adventure and ideals of selfless service amongst young citizens. Further, it aims at
                    creating a pool of organized, trained and motivated youth with leadership qualities in all
                    walks of life, who will serve the Nation regardless of which career they choose. Needless to
                    say, the NCC also provides an environment conducive to motivating young Indians to join the
                    armed forces.</p>

                    1946 with Pt HN Kunzru as chairman held six meetings in South Block, New Delhi. At the same
                    time, Pt HN Kunzru formed sub-committees which were sent on study tours in all the main
                    provinces of pre-independent India including provinces which are now located in Bangladesh and
                    Pakistan. One sub-committee was also sent on tour to Great Britain and France from 15 Feb 1947
                    to 31 Mar 1947 to study the Youth and Cadet organisations in those countries.</p>

                <p align="justify" class="paragraph u-margin-bottom-small">The Cadet Corps Committee carried out exhaustive study
                    of the problem of youth in India. Its sub-committees after their tour at home and abroad
                    submitted their report to the Govt of India in Mar 1947. Soon after the report was submitted, a
                    far reaching political development began to impact the country, due to which the Cadet Corps
                    Scheme had to be kept in abeyance. The religious strife which then was at its zenith,
                    ultimately led to the partition of the country into India and Pakistan.</p>

                <p align="justify" class="paragraph u-margin-bottom-small">On the stroke of midnight of 14/15 Aug 1947, India
                    achieved her independence. Immediately after independence, India was confronted with problems
                    of formidable magnitude concerning not only repatriation of millions of displaced persons from
                    Pakistan but also a full scale invasion of Kashmir by the Armed tribesmen supported by
                    Pakistan. The armed forces had to rush to retrieve Kashmir at a time when they were already
                    pre-occupied with the internal problem of maintaining law and order during the country's
                    initial stage of consolidation.</p>

                <p align="justify" class="paragraph u-margin-bottom-big">The war in Kashmir and the consequent loss of a portion of
                    Indian territory; the open support of Western Powers to Pakistan in the Security Council of the
                    United Nations, made it more than evident to the Indian leaders that they not only had to
                    strengthen the Armed Forces but also create sufficient strength of reserves, who could take up
                    arms, when required. The gravity of time and event found expression in the Indian Legislature
                    through anxious and pressing demand for military training of young men and women throughout the
                    country.</p>

                            The Kashmir War of 1948 taught a very important lesson to India, that freedom needs to
                            be protected by strong Armed Forces. Its immediate manifestation was that the
                            recommendations of Kunzuru committee were placed before the Constituent Assembly
                            (Legislature) on 13 Mar 1948. A draft Bill was sent to the Constituent Assembly
                            (Legislative) on 19 Mar 1948, which evoked great interest and enthusiasm amongst all
                            members. After due deliberations and amendments, the Bill was passed by the Assembly on
                            08 Apr 1948. The Central Govt accepted the opinion of the Provincial Govts and the
                            Standing Committee's recommendations for the formation of a Cadet Corps which was to be
                            named as "National Cadet Corps", as recommended by the Kunzuru Committee.

                            'The National Cadet Corps Act 1948'. This Act with 13 clauses, prescribed the formation

                            The NCC flag for various units of the NCC was first introduced in 1951. The flag was of
                            same pattern, colour and size as was used by various regiments of the Army. The only
                            difference was that it had the NCC badge and unit designation placed in the centre.
                            Later on it was felt that the flag should be in keeping with the inter-service
                            character of the Corps. In 1954 the existing tricolour flag was introduced. The three
                            colours in the flag depict the three services of the Corps, red for the Army, deep blue
                            for the Navy and light blue for the Air Force. The letters NCC and the NCC crest in
                            gold in the middle of the flag encircled by a wreath of lotus, give the flag a
                            colourful look and a distinct identity.

                            History Of NCC Song
                        </h3>
                        <p align="justify" class="paragraph u-margin-top-small-2">
                            The desirability of composing a NCC song was considered in the Circle Commanders (now
                            called DDGs) Conference held in January 1956 and all circles were asked to send their
                            proposals. The official song of the NCC - "Kadam Mila Ke Chal" was adopted in 1963, and
                            registered in 1969 with the approval of the Ministry of Defence. In 1974, it was felt
                            that the NCC song had failed to catch the imagination of the youth, and there was a
                            need for a change. A sustained process began; entries were invited from Directorates
                            for suitable lyrics; 107 entries were received; of which eight were selected by a Board
                            of Officers. However, all the eight were considered sub standard by Dr Nagendra of
                            Delhi University, who was the judge. On the suggestion of Dr Nagendra, the task was
                            entrusted to Shri Chiranjit, the Chief Producer, Drama Division, AIR, Delhi.

                        <p align="justify" class="paragraph u-margin-top-small-2">
                            The song written by Shri Chiranjit was approved, in 1976. The Maharashtra Directorate
                            was asked to get the song composed and recorded with the help of Shri Raj Kapoor, and
                            the Films Division, Bombay. However, nothing much came out of this exercise as Shri Raj
                            Kapoor was then busy in making his film "Satyam Shivam Sundaram" and the studios of the
                            Films Division were under renovation. Later, Shri Mahinder Singh Bedi, a well known
                            poet of Delhi, was requested to write another song. This effort also proved
                            infructuous. AEC Centre Pachmarhi was also approached, but somehow the matter could not
                            be finalized.
