                            I am Cadet Mayank Thakur.

                            “LIFE IN NCC BEGINS WITH A SHOOT AND ENDS WITH A THUMB AND A STAGE IN BETWEEN- WE BECOME
                            ASPIRING CADET.”

                            I was enrolled in NCC in starting week of August, this year in one of the highly escalated
                            unit among Chandigarh directorate, a unit which is known for its contribution in
                            Nation-Building and the one who has won glory in many Group and Directorates level
                            competition, the “3 PB BN NCC, LDH”.

                            When I reached for the recruitment, I was amazed to see the josh of our college students,
                            around 300 students were present and only 26 have the chance of becoming cadets that day. I
                            was nervous but I composed by thoughts and grew faith in myself that howsoever the
                            selection process will be I will throw my best and get the “gold” out of the situation. One
                            thing that kept me always high were the motivating words of the seniors who were on duty
                            and of course their uniform that inspired me to give my best. On the very first day, we
                            reported to the sports complex sharp at 1600hrs and we interacted freely to our seniors.
                            Then we introduced ourselves among each other including our seniors. Then from the next day
                            the real drill initiated. We learnt basics like standing in attention and stand at ease
                            position. We learnt parade and many different things that is essential not in NCC but also
                            in different spheres of life. There were also punishments if we did a mistake or didn’t
                            follow our seniors’ orders. Every day, we used to run 3 to 4 rounds of the track and we
                            observed a change in our physique. I am able to do more pushups now. We were not only
                            taught drill parades but skills were inculcated in our personality that defined us as an
                            officer. Army personnel gave regular visit and have conversation with us. Me and my other
                            NCC mates are now more inclined and focused towards defence forces.

                            Jai Hind!!!!!!

                            My self PB16SDA162660 UO PARTH DWIVEDI.

                            Two things that have become my muscle memory- commander and my rifle. “Holding, aiming,
                            triggering” for my rifle and “Ji Shabh/ Ok Sir, Jai Hind” to my commander.

                            TSC (Thal Sainik Camp) was the first camp I attended. We had to stay in the NCC academy of
                            Malout- no shops, no signs of crowded human activity at least for a radius of five
                            kilometers. The food and bathrooms were a quality trademark that would never slip from my
                            memory.

                            We wake at 0500 hrs, make ourselves fresh, go for P.T., return to our barracks for bath and
                            breakfast, report to ground for drill parades in uniform, attend lectures, have short
                            intervals, then a long queue for lunch and rest. Again ready for lecture, then OT, followed
                            by roll call and ended with cultural performance.

                            We were away from our home but nearer to our descendants- the nature. By the end of the
                            tenth day, we learned that humans can adapt to any situation. Adding to it, the discipline
                            that those rigorous NCC drills inculcated into us. We undergone the practical application
                            of the subjects like Map reading and FCBC.

                            In the last week of April, came the big new for me -THE SHOOTING CAMP, in which I had 100%
                            interest and that talent of mine made me selected in five base camp of three days each.
                            Then there was an Inter Battalion Competition. But the shooting was a moment of art work
                            for me. I would decorate my target like anything.

                            My hard work of two years of NCC pays and I got a Gold medal for Best Shooter in
                            competition, also our team got silver medal for 2nd rank in all the battalions of Ludhiana
                            group. After that there is an Inter Group Competition in Ropar that I attended and filled
                            my brain with soul of memories.

                            !!JAI HIND!!
