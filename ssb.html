                                achieve the objectives set by him/her. What is seen is, if you can convince others to

                                <span id="black"> Factor IV:</span> Dynamic. This factor includes three qualities which

                                the life of subordinates and that is undesirable. Hence, what is important is
                                ‘calculated risks when required’.
